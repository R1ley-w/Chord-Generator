# Chord-Generator
application allows the user to choose any sequence of notes and outputs a jazz chord progression that fits all the chords in. 

Core Idea 
The app has three main functional pillars:
1. Input: A user-defined sequence of notes (melody).
2. Processing: A model that generates a context-aware chord progression (harmony) based on the melody and a user-controlled "surprise" factor.
3. Output: An 8-bar rhythmic arrangement of the generated progression for playback and experimentation.
